# Cam-Scanner

A Cam Scanner designed using Open CV.

Building a document scanner with OpenCV can be accomplished in just three simple steps:

Step 1: Detect edges.
Step 2: Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
Step 3: Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
Really. Thatâ€™s it.
